# Sets of skins
A set of skins is composed by at least 4 individual skins. These skins are to be used with EzQuake's /teamforceskin and /enemyforceskin commands, with the value 3. 
The value 3 will automatically assign skins to your teammates / enemies, **so you can distinguish them during the game**.

Details on http://ezquake.sourceforge.net/docs/?player-skins

**Usage:**
choose the set that you like. You can choose one for teammates and/or other for enemies. copy the skins files to your quake/qw/skins folder. 
In the game, set */enemyforceskin 3* to set the e1-e4 skins to be assigned to your enemy

 set */teamforceskin 3* to set the t1-t4 skins to be assigned to your teammates!

The game is expecting the following skin files under quake/qw/skins to work with */enemyforceskin 3*:

`e1 
e2 
e3
e4`

The game is expecting the following skin files under quake/qw/skins to work with */teamforceskin 3*:
