Skins for the Quake multiplayer community

New and old skins, for both the new and regular player model.

Eventually some of these skins will get uploaded to https://gfx.quakeworld.nu/

# contribute
Feel free to create new skins based on any of these. We encourage you to do it. For your team, your teammate, your neighbour!

Send new skins to mushi (or use git), they will be uploaded here.
