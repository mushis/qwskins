# qwskins
Skins for the Quake multiplayer community. Because *beautiful skins don't compromise visibility*.

New and old skins, for both the new and regular player model.

choose a skin for you or your team! make your own, oh and how about distinguising enemies during the game? You got it right here.

# contribute
If you make a skin, please share it with the community. Others will see your skin in the game (as long as they set */teamskin* or */enemyskin* to "" - empty). Feel free to create new skins (we recommend using Primevil ones, see  https://gfx.quakeworld.nu/browse/skins/). We encourage you to do it. For your team, your teammate, your neighbour!

Send new skins to mushi (or use git), they will be uploaded here.

**Can't see a skin in the game, even though your friend has it set?**
- do you have it on your quake/qw/skins folder? there must be a file there, with the same name as the skin you want to see.

- have you set  */teamskin* and */enemyskin* to ""? these commands must be set to empty, or else your client will force the usage of a skin, and you will not see individual skins

**I want to use the sets for the enemies, but i can't see the different skins!**
- make sure the e1-e4 skin files are on quake/qw/skins and that you have set */enemyforceskin 3*. 
- the equivalent for sets for the teammates
