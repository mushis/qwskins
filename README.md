Skins for the Quake multiplayer community

New and old skins, for both the new and regular player model.

Eventually some of these skins will get uploaded to https://gfx.quakeworld.nu/ for convenience.

choose a skin for you or your team! make your own, oh and how about distinguising enemies during the game? You got it right here.

# contribute
If you make a skin, please share it with the community. Others will see your skin in the game (as long as they set */teamskin* or */enemyskin* to "" - empty). Feel free to create new skins based on any of these, or even Primevil ones (great skins! https://gfx.quakeworld.nu/browse/skins/). We encourage you to do it. For your team, your teammate, your neighbour!

Send new skins to mushi (or use git), they will be uploaded here.
